# Train_Scheduler

Train Scheduler uses Firebase to store the train information. The user can add trains to the schedule and those will be stored in Firebase as well.
Train Scheduler also uses Moment.JS to convert the time to different formats and calculate the difference between the current time and the next train arrival time. The form includes user validation to ensure the correct information is entered for a new train. This project also includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript & jQuery.
